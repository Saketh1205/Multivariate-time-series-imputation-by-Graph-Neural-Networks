# Multivariate-time-series-imputation-by-Graph-Neural-Networks
The objective of multivariate time series imputation (MTSI) is to properly fill missing values 
in a (multivariate) sequence of data.

# Graph Recurrent Imputation Network(GRIN) 
GRIN is a graph-based, bidirectional, recurrent neural network which aims to reconstruct 
the input sequence by leveraging on both the temporal and spatial dimensions.
GRIN reconstructs missing data in the different channels of a multivariate 
time series by learning spatio-temporal representations through 
message passing.
